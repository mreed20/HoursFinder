# SETTING UP DATABASE

After installing Postgres SQL, you should have the command `psql` available in
your terminal.  To load the `teacher`, `student`, and `classes` tables into
your database follow these steps:

1. Start Postgres SQL. It should use the hostname `localhost` and port `5432`
   by default.

2. Open a terminal.

3. Navigate (via `cd`) to the directory containing the file `public.sql`

4. Load public.sql into your database with the command `psql -h localhost
   public < public.sql`. It is important to not change `public` to anything
   else, since the Java code assumes that all tables (e.g., `teacher`) are in
   the `public` database.
